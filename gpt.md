i want this website to look like no other website out there.
[make heavy use of native CSS animations,scroll and view, (im not gonna use any JS lib or JS for animations.) make each and every piece of the website look lively. and do a smart use of colors and color theory.]
[comment the whole code well. ]
[keep the code SEO friendly. even though, I'm gonna do SEO afterwards, still keep the code in such a manner, that it wont take much tweak to make it SEO friendly.]
[for the time being, use free stock photos as place holders]
1 a modern, unconventional header/navbar.
2 a modern hero section having text and image (perhaps a gif or a video loop as background).
3 then the offered programs section(a small cards): each card show some detail upon hover and go to another page upon a click.
4 then small video cards with some hover effects.
5 then other testimonials.
6. then parting text and a small contact form.
7. a footer with sitemap and a newsletter form, socials, etc.
